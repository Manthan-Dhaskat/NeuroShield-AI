# 📖 Overview

NeuroShield AI is an autonomous cybersecurity platform that continuously monitors system behavior, detects anomalous activities using Artificial Intelligence, prioritizes threats through risk scoring, and automatically executes mitigation actions in real time.

Unlike traditional antivirus solutions that rely on predefined malware signatures, NeuroShield uses behavioral analysis and machine learning to identify previously unseen threats, making it effective against zero-day attacks and evolving malware variants.

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Develop an intelligent threat-response framework that autonomously:

- Detects cyber threats in real time
- Prioritizes threats based on severity
- Executes mitigation actions automatically
- Provides explainable AI-driven threat analysis
- Displays all activities through a real-time dashboard

NeuroShield addresses this challenge through a complete AI-driven threat detection and response pipeline.

# 🚀 Key Features

## 🔍 Real-Time System Monitoring

Continuously monitors:

- CPU Usage
- Memory Usage
- Disk Usage
- Running Processes
- Network Activity
- System Health Metrics

---

## 🤖 AI-Powered Threat Detection

Uses an **Isolation Forest** machine learning model to:

- Learn normal system behavior
- Detect behavioral anomalies
- Identify unknown malware
- Generate anomaly confidence scores

### Why Isolation Forest?

Traditional antivirus software depends on malware signatures.

NeuroShield instead learns what normal behavior looks like and flags suspicious deviations, enabling detection of:

- Zero-day threats
- Unknown malware
- Insider attacks
- Suspicious process behavior

---

## ⚠️ Intelligent Threat Scoring

Threat severity is determined using:

- AI anomaly score
- CPU utilization
- Memory utilization
- Process behavior
- Network behavior

### Severity Levels

| Risk Score | Severity |
|------------|-----------|
| 0 – 25 | LOW |
| 26 – 50 | MEDIUM |
| 51 – 75 | HIGH |
| 76 – 100 | CRITICAL |

---

## 🛑 Autonomous Response Engine

Automatically performs mitigation actions based on threat severity.

| Severity | Action |
|-----------|---------|
| LOW | Monitor |
| MEDIUM | Alert |
| HIGH | Quarantine |
| CRITICAL | Kill Process + Create Incident |

---

## 📊 Real-Time Dashboard

Provides live visibility into:

- System Health
- Threat Feed
- Threat History
- Incident Logs
- Analytics
- Response Actions

All updates are streamed using WebSockets.

# ⚙️ How NeuroShield Works

## Step 1 — System Monitoring

The monitoring layer continuously collects:

- CPU Usage
- Memory Usage
- Disk Usage
- Process Information
- Network Statistics

Example:

```json
{
  "cpu_usage": 45,
  "memory_usage": 61,
  "disk_usage": 30
}
```

---

## Step 2 — Feature Extraction

Raw monitoring metrics are converted into AI-ready features.

Example:

```json
{
  "cpu_usage": 92,
  "memory_usage": 87,
  "network_connections": 250
}
```

---

## Step 3 — Anomaly Detection

The Isolation Forest model evaluates incoming system behavior.

Example Output:

```json
{
  "anomaly_score": 0.91
}
```

Higher anomaly scores indicate more suspicious behavior.

---

## Step 4 — Threat Scoring

Risk score is calculated using:

```python
risk_score =
(anomaly_score * 60) +
(cpu_usage / 100 * 15) +
(memory_usage / 100 * 15)
```

Example:

```json
{
  "anomaly_score": 0.91,
  "risk_score": 87,
  "severity": "CRITICAL"
}
```

---

## Step 5 — Autonomous Response

Based on severity:

```text
LOW       → Monitor
MEDIUM    → Alert
HIGH      → Quarantine
CRITICAL  → Kill Process
```

Response actions are logged and incidents are created automatically.

---

## Step 6 — Dashboard Visualization

Detected threats are pushed to the frontend through WebSockets.

Users can see:

- Live threats
- System metrics
- Response actions
- Incident creation
- Threat analytics

without refreshing the page.
